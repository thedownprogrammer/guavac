                           Announcing: guavac 1.0
                     A free compiler for the Java language
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After twelve public beta releases, Effective Edge is proud to release version
1.0 of the guavac compiler.  This includes many bug fixes over previous
versions as well as support for JDK 1.1 inner classes.

Guavac can be freely used and distributed under the terms of the Gnu Public
License.  This is an early release and may be difficult for non-programmers
to compile and use.

All materials needed to compile a Netscape/Explorer compliant applet are
included in the guavac distribution.  NO proprietary code from Sun is needed,
so other tool writers should feel free to include guavac in their systems.

Guavac was written in C++ to compile on any Unix system.  This has been
tested under Solaris 2.x, SunOS 4.x, DEC OSF, Iris 5.3, HP/UX 9, and Linux 1.x 
using gcc-2.7.2 and libg++-2.7.1 and binutils-2.6, but other operating systems
should work without any major changes.
*****************************************************************************
* You absolutely need these, or later, versions, of gcc, libg++ and binutils *

developers to exchange ideas and solutions.  To join the list, send mail to:

     subscribe guavac

We developed guavac with the intentions of including it with a large-
scale network simulation environment, but have since decided not to
commercialize guavac or any product based upon it.  We are now giving
guavac away under the terms of the Gnu Public License in the hopes that
other people may find it useful and contribute, in turn, to its future.

support, or technology parterships, contact Effective Edge at:
