       GGuuaavvaacc is a compiler for the Java  (TM)  programming  lan-
       guage  distributed  under  the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.
       You should feel free to use, copy and modify it, based  on
       the  terms  in the COPYING file included in this distribu-
       tion.  We are distributing gguuaavvaacc free of  charge  in  the
       hopes  that  other people will find it useful and possibly
       enhance its utility in turn.

       All  materials  needed  to  compile   a   HotJava(TM)   or
       Netscape(TM)  compliant  applet are included in the gguuaavvaacc
       distribution.  No proprietary code from Sun is needed,  so
       other  tool  writers should feel free to include gguuaavvaacc in
       their systems.

       GGuuaavvaacc is written in C++ to compile on  any  Unix  system.
       This  has  been  tested under Solaris 2.x, SunOS 4.x, Iris
       5.3,  HP/UX  9,  and  Linux  1.x  using  GNU's  gcc-2.7.2,
       libg++-2.7.1 and binutils-2.6, but other operating systems
       should work without any major changes.

       GGuuaavvaacc is not meant to be the definite GNU Java  compiler.
       There's  a  different project in the works at Cygnus, that
       aims at building a GNU CC front-end for Java.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       GGuuaavvaacc recognizes the following options.

       --ccllaassssppaatthh _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              Set the _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_.  It maybe  contains  either  the
              stub  classes  as  distributed  with  gguuaavvaacc iinn tthhee
              _c_l_a_s_s_e_s_._z_i_p file. Or, even  better,  the  directory
              where the classes of Sun's Java Development Kit, or
              JDK for short, reside.

       --dd _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              Set the output directory which  otherwise  defaults
              to the current working directory.

       --MM     Prints  out dependencies for compiled files instead
              of compiling.

       --vveerrssiioonn
              Prints out the current version of guavac.

       Refer to the BUGS section below on philosophical  implica-
       tions of any collection of OPTIONS.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       GGuuaavvaacc recognizes the CLASSPATH environment variable, con-
       taining a colon separated list  of  directories  where  to
       look  for  compiled  Java  classes; much like the standard
       PATH variable used to find executables.   The  setting  of
       CLASSPATH may be overriden with the --ccllaassssppaatthh option.

BBUUGGSS
       At  present,  after  11 official releases, gguuaavvaacc 0.2.5 is
       relatively  stable.   However,   incompatibilities   arise
       between  guavac  and  Sun's  offerings,  most of which are
       fixed shortly after discovery.
