List of needed and desired changes to guavac, in no particular order:

The biggest thing that is needed is a more intelligent dependancy analysis.
Right now, guavac works great if you are compiling one source file against
any number of .class files, but it has serious problems with multiple
uncompiled sources, especially when faced with circular dependancies.  This
is a really hard problem, and all of my half-efforts to fix it have failed.

Additional language changes required in the 1.1 inner classes doc.  These
include variant forms of .new, .class, .this which all break LALR.  There is
a bug filed on this with Javasoft, so they may fix the spec instead of guavac
needing to implement the broken version.

Traverse code after generation, verify stack sizes.

Can only declare 'throws' for subclasses of parent's thrown classes.

Expand error reporting to give more errors in a method after failure.  (hard)
